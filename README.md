# LiveWorld
LiveWorld is the culmination of all of my experience with programming and Unity. It is an attempt to create a framework for my own, private, digital world. While it is freely downloadable, open-source, and freely modifiable, I have not written it in any way that it should be easy to modify. You are welcome to do with it what you wish as long as it follows the license included, but I won't help you do it. That being said, the nature of my coding style may make it easy anyway, without my even trying.

This is LiveWorld, the framework of my world.
